### How Can I Contribute?

#### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Suggesting Enhancements

#### Your First Code Contribution

- **Commit your changes** making sure to use a descriptive commit message.
- **Push your changes** to your forked repository.

### Styleguides

#### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

#### Code Styleguide

- Include comments explaining why certain code decisions were made.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.
